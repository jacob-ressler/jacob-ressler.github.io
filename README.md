## About the Project

This was my first project working with Angular, so there may be some unconventionality in places. For the most part, I think things turned out well. It served as a good sandbox to learn and experiment with Angular.

### Some things I learned

- Angular
  - CLI
  - Components
  - Services
  - Directives
  - FontAwesome integration
- Modular SPA design
- TypeScript syntax

### Frameworks

- Angular

### Languages

- HTML5
- SCSS
- TypeScript
- JSON

## Features

### Responsive design

- Text and element resizing based on screen/window dimensions
- Unique layouts for portrait vs landscape

### Simple layout and navigation

- Single-page application
- All information is accessible within a few clicks
- Interactible elements are clearly denoted

### Aesthetically pleasing design

- Simple color scheme and palette
- Non-intrusive images
- Subtle transition effects

## Angular Auto-generated Information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
