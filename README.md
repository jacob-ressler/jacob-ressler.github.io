# My Portfolio

I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory.

## General Design Idea

I want the page to act "modularly", where mousing over or clicking on a navbar item will swap the current page module for the one belonging to the selected navbar item.

## Known Issues/Bugs

None currently, so let's keep it that way.

## Languages Used

- HTML5
- [Sass](sass-lang.com) / CSS
